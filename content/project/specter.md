Specter is a singleplayer action platformer with puzzle elements. Think Mario meets Castlevania. I’m doing all of the programming and a friend of mine the art. Jonah Backfish is responsible for the music. We are currently working on a demo or preview version which we will make available for free. The game is build with XNA GameStudio but I might port it to MonoXNA for Linux and Mac support (too bad their content pipeline isn’t finished yet).
