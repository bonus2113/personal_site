SPiN WARS is a fun party game for 2 – 4 players. It can be played on mobile platforms as well as on PC, Mac and Linux. I worked on SPiN WARS during the time I spent as an intern at Brightside Games. My main responsibility was porting the controls from mobile (touch) to keyboard, mouse and controllers. We used Unity3D and C#.
