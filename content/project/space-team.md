Space Team: Pocket Planets is the second project I worked on during my time at EUCROMA. It is a mobile game in which you have to take care of a miniature planet. Your task is it to keep the inhabitants of your planets happy, for example by growing food or providing them with sunlight. It ties into the Space Team storyworld.
