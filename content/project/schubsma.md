Schubsma is a game I worked on during a 24 hour game jam for the show “Pixelmacher” of the German TV channel “ZDF Kultur”. They wanted a team of six people to create a game about motherhood for an episode with the theme “heroine”. I was one of the three programmers and worked with one producer and two artists. We implemented the first prototype on one weekend, having never worked together before.
