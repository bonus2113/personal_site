Blood Trial is the game my team and I made at the Global Game Jam 2013 in Berlin. It is a 2D one-screen brawler. Somewhat in the style of Super Smash Bros. 2 – 4 player fight in an arena style setting to win the favor of the gods. They gain favor by ripping other players hearts out and sacrificing them at the pyramide.We had 48 hours to finish this game and it was a blast. Working with 6 other highly skilled people until exhaustion is an experience no one should miss.
