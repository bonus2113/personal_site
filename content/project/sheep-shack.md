Sheep Shack is the first game I worked on during my time at Brightside Games and it is the one Iâ€™m most attached to. I got to work on all major phases of its development cycle, from early prototype to near gold master. I mostly did general game programming (with Unity3D and C#). I am especially proud of the fact, that I was responsible for finding and solving a major performance problem (and reducing the number of draw calls from ~200 to ~20) with almost no knowledge of graphics programming at the time.
