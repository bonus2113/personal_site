# Biography
I am a software engineer interested in computer graphics, physically based rendering and real time graphics.
Currently I am studying computer science at RWTH Aachen and am employed as a student research assistant at the [Visual Computing Institute](//graphics.rwth-aachen.de) where I work on software for laser cutting.

I am particularly interested in global illumination techniques, you can check out some of my recent projects on [Github](//github.com/daseyb).

If you want to see what I'm working on right now check out my [Tumblr page](//daseyb.tumblr.com), I use it as a gallery for in progress projects.
