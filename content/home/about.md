# About Me
I am a software engineer interested in computer graphics, physically based rendering and real time graphics.
Currently I am studying computer science at RWTH Aachen and am employed as a student research assistant at the [Visual Computing Institute](//graphics.rwth-aachen.de) where I work on software for laser cutting.

I am particularly interested in global illumination techniques, you can check out some of my recent projects on [Github](//github.com/daseyb).

Currently I spend a lot of my time working on [AnimVR](//nvrmind.io/#animvr) and art creation tools for VR in general.
